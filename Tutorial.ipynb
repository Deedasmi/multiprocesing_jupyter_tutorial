In this tutorial we will analyze a 4.3GB file containing more than 446 million passwords. We will face two major challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "First, with large files we won't be able to fit the entire dataset into memory. While we technically could with this 4.3GB file, I hope to do similiar work on a 170GB file in the future. That file definitly would not fit in our machine's memory. We beat this by only reading a part of the file at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, there is a lot of work to do. Every operation I want to perform on these words, like finding the most common letter, I have to do 446 million times. Since each password can be analyzed individually regardless of how the other passwords look, we can do multiple words at a time."

    "## The first problem: Dealing with large datasets\n",
    "Having a lot of data is both a good thing. It allows us to find more interesting facts about our data. For example, I could ask this dataset if the most common third character in a password was a number or letter. With only 100 passwords I don't have significant confidence in what my data is telling me. With nearly 450 million passwords I can make a pretty effective guess. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is also a burdan. It takes time to process all that data. For example, my test case has been a 4.3GB csv file that contains no columns, only a single password per line. When we attempt to load this into a pandas dataframe, pandas attempts to analyze it all at once and does so very ineffeciently. When I attempted this on my computer with 16 GB of RAM, pandas kept trying to analyze my 4.3GB file until it had taken up nearly 25 GB of memory, well more than my computer actually has. It didn't even finish, I had to kill the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/pandas.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we write something like this. This code is a special type of function called a generator. It allows us to read small pieces of the file, and analyze chunks of it at a time instead of all at once. This does prevent us from doing any type of correlation analysis directly on the data, as we will never have all of the data at once. In my case, this is fine. "

This means that in order to analyze our data we will be dealing with a lot of things we don't need, which we will call overhead. In this case, at least 20GB of data that was loaded we didn't need. This severely increases the time it takes to analyze large data sets. So we have decided to not use Pandas, and instead build our own analysis tools.
